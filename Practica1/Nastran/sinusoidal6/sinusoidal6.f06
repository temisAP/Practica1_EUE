   solutions.
  
     MSC Nastran 2020 SP1 corrects four defects, evident in version 2020,
     that concern the import of Nastran Embedded Fatigue and acoustic pressure
     results into Patran, corrects a licensing defect concerning the
     TABLRPC entry, and shell elements SFRP failure indicator output in
     the Digimat-to-SOL 400 MATDIGI interface.

     Fatigue
     - Control of the number of angles to be analyzed when using critical plane
       analysis.
     - New stress/strain output requests via FATIGUE case control.
     - More control over the amound of results data returned at critical
       locations.
     - Significant performance improvement of SOL 112 duty cycle jobs.
     - Direct access to dynamic load data in multi-channel time histroy files via
       new TABLRPC entry.
  
     Topology Optimization
     - Anisotropic materials support added.
     - Over-hang constraints for additive manufacturing.
     - New DRESP2 response types: Magnigtude of Displacement and
       maximization of stiffness and frequency.
1 
     Nonlinear
     - Nonlinear Buckling available in SOL 400
     - Allow represtentation of imperfect structural geometry through
       use modification of grid coordinates based on displacements or
       modes from a previous run.
     - MATVE limitation of five scale factor/time constraint data pairs
       removed.
  
     HPC
     - CASI (Iterative) Solver support available for inertia relief analysis.
     - Faster Global Transformation Matrix for ACMS to speed up Nastran
       interface to MSC Adams and AVL EXCITE.
     - Improved GPU acceleration for FASTFR (Fast Frequency Response) and
       MPYAD for large models.
  
     Nastran HDF5
